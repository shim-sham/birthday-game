## why I made this
I wanted to recap on my basic python and i just love making these types of adventure games with a narrative

## how I made this
I planned (minimally) the general structure of the game and the map. I started with the basic helper functions (bag check + 'help') and did each of the rooms afterwards.
## what I struggled with and what I learned
- struggled with remembering to alter each and every room based on what the user has chosen in the game
- learnt that i can use brython for outputting python as a website. also learnt that it's too hard for me to convert that many lines of python into brython.
- learnt that i can use binder to share python code so people can run it in a virtual terminal
